# terrustrial-stats
Turrustrial-stats is a high performance geostats library written entirely in rust.

Terrustrial is under active development 
- breaking changes are expected
- features missing

# Implemented Features
- Experimental variogram computation
- Spherical variogram
- simple kriging

 # Planned Features
 ## Variography
 - Visualization
 - Vectorize experimental variogram
 - Pairwise relative experimental varigram
 - More theoretical varigorams (Exponential, Gaussian, Matern...)
   
 ## Estimation
 - Ordinary Kriging
   
 ## Simulation
 - Gaussian simulation methods (SGS, GSGS, DBSIM)
 - Multi-point simulation methods (SNESIM, FILTERSIM)
 - High-Order simulation methods (HOSIM)

# Performance
- Improve vectorization
- Parallelize
